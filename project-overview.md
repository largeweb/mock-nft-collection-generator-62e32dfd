# Project Overview

Project Name: Mock NFT Collection Generator

Description: A web application for generating mock NFT collections. This app simulates the creation process, allowing users to customize parameters like collection name, symbol, number of NFTs, and visual traits. It does not actually create NFTs on a blockchain.

Features:
*   Collection Customization: Users can set the name, symbol, and size of their mock NFT collection.
*   Trait Configuration:  A system for defining mock traits (e.g., background, body, hat) and their possible values.
*   Visual Generation:  The app will generate mock NFT images based on the configured traits.
*   Mock Minting: A simulated "mint" button to show a transaction confirmation.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
